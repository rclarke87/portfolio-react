              I'm a team leader, systems thinker and front-end developer with a
              passion for building functional, user-friendly applications. With
              a background in life sciences and project management, I bring a
              solid grasp of complex projects, enjoy big-picture thinking and
              excel at communicating technical topics clearly. I'm currently
              focused on mastering Tailwind and React, while staying curious and
              committed to continuous learning.
            </p>

            <p className="text-xl mt-4">
              Beyond work, I have too many hobbies and interestes to count,
              there's self-hosting, data science, machine learning and creating
              tools that tackle real-world problems. When I'm not coding, youâ€™ll
              likely find me tinkering with microcontrollers, brewing beer,
              experimenting with Linux or diving into my next big side project.
              I love a good challenge and thrive when collaborating with people
              who care about thoughtful design and writing code that makes a
              difference.
