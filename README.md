# Personal Portfolio Website

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website, showcasing my projects, skills, and professional background as a React and Next.js developer.

The website is built using:
- React
- Vite
- Tailwind CSS

## Development

To get started with local development:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL] # Replace [YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL] with the actual URL
    cd [PROJECT_DIRECTORY_NAME] # Replace [PROJECT_DIRECTORY_NAME] with the folder name
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    This will start the Vite development server, typically available at `http://localhost:5173`.
